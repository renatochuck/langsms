# LangSMS - Anonymous SMS Sender

LangSMS is a powerful anonymous SMS sending tool that allows you to send messages while staying secure using VPNs.

## Features

- Uses VPN (ProtonVPN) to mask your identity.
- Supports multi-number sending with different VPN configurations.
- Secure and easy to use.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your **Kali Linux** machine:
- Python 3
- `requests` library

```
- Choose **option 1** to send a single SMS.
- Enter the phone number with the country code (e.g., `+15555555555`).
- Type your message (Note: Links are not allowed due to API restrictions).

### Multiple SMS Mode (VPN Required)
- Ensure you have ProtonVPN config files (`.ovpn`) in a directory.
- Prepare a file containing phone numbers (one per line, including country code).
- Run:
```bash
python3 langsms.py
```
- Choose **option 2** and provide the necessary paths for VPN configs and phone number file.
